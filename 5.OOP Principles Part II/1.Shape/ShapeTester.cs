﻿/*Define abstract class Shape with only one abstract method CalculateSurface() and fields width 
 * and height. Define two new classes Triangle and Rectangle that implement the virtual method and r
 * eturn the surface of the figure (height*width for rectangle and height*width/2 for triangle). Define 
 * class Circle and suitable constructor so that at initialization height must be kept equal to width and 
 * implement the CalculateSurface() method. Write a program that tests  the behavior of  the CalculateSurface() 
 * method for different shapes (Circle, Rectangle, Triangle) stored in an array.*/
